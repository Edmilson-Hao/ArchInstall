# ArchLinuxInstall
Welcome to the Arch Linux Script Installer.
This script was created to automate the process of the Arch linux system installation proccess.
At first its just a small thing and I am no professional at bash script but it will soon be a
great tool to automate the proccess of having a very minimal installation.
